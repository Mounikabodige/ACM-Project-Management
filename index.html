            Objects : Instances of a class.
            Classes : referred to as a Business Object.
            Entity : Anything form the real world whihc is significant enough to be created as a class.

            <strong>Abstraction : </strong>
            Identify only the requirements
            Process of creating the classes ignoring the reality based on the requirements.
            Simpify data only consider the things related to the requirment.
            Focus important things for our purpose / application requirement.

            <strong>Encapsulation : </strong>
            Encapuslate the data implementation within a class.
            To protect the data from modifying from outside.

            Sepearation of concern.
            The process of decomposing the application into parts with minimal overlapping
            each part is responsible for individual concern.
            * Minimize Coupling.
            * Maximize Cohesion.
            * Simplifies maintenance.
            * Improves testability.

        <h1>Relationships</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>Collaboration("Uses a") : </strong>
            An object uses another object to collaborate but are not related.
            <strong>Composition ("has a") : </strong>
            A relation where an object is composed of other objects it needs.
            Order has a Customer.
            Aggregation : Object is composed of multiple objects that can exsist outside of the relationship.
            A customer can exsist even without an order. But all orders have a customer, there is no order without customer.
            <strong>Inheritance ("is a") : </strong>
            Customer types -> Can be a residential, bussiness etc.
            child class is dervied from Parent class.

        <strong>Static Classes</strong>
        <p>
            A static class cannot be instantiated. Cannot be used new keyword to create a instance.
            Access members of a static class using a class name.
            All members must be static.
